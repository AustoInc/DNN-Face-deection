it detects faces at real time and it is also capable of detecting multiple faces and their landmarks sort of thing

it uses a pretrained onnx model btw ....
load the model and run the code...make sure to pass in the path to the model in your code ...

any help setting up the project is covered in the cmake text lists file ...else you want to try sth else

Happy coding!!!!!!!!!
